## What is Dystopia?

Dystopia is an open source Python Discord Bot that works as a backdoor that you can control from a Discord server. It uses the **Discord API** to communicate between the agent and the Discord server.

Its power is showecased in this [video](https://youtu.be/q7jqRg1sxBU)

## How does the Terminator work?

It simply searches for possible files/directories and registry keys that Dystopia leaves on the target machine after its first execution and deletes them permanetly.

## How to use the Terminator?

You can either use the precompiled EXE found in the releases or manually execute the code found inside the code directory of this repository. 

If Dystopia is detected it will ask you if you want to delete it or not. After the deletion you will need to press [ENTER] to close the Terminator.
